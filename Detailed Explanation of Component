### 1.NetworkTrafficSimulator Class

This class is responsible for generating network traffic. It has the following attributes and methods:

- **Attributes**:
    
    - `num_devices`: The number of devices to simulate in the network.
    - `attack_percentage`: The percentage of traffic that should be simulated as attacks.
    - `traffic_data`: A list that stores the generated traffic data.
- **Methods**:
    
    - `generate_traffic()`: Generates random traffic data for the specified number of devices and categorizes them as normal or malicious.
    - `start_simulation()`: Starts the traffic generation process in a loop until stopped.
    - `stop_simulation()`: Stops the traffic generation.
### 2. NetworkSecurityVisualizer Class

This class manages the GUI for the application. It includes:

- **Widgets**: Input fields for the number of devices and attack percentage, along with buttons to start/stop simulation and visualize traffic.
- **Methods**:
    - `start_simulation()`: Validates user input and starts the traffic simulation.
    - `stop_simulation()`: Stops the ongoing simulation.
    - `visualize_traffic()`: Processes the collected traffic data and creates a pie chart for visualization.
